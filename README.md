The "Simon Says" game you are referring to is likely the electronic memory game called "Simon." This game tests your memory by having you repeat a sequence of colors and sounds that becomes progressively longer and more complex.

**Here’s how the game works:

1..Starting the Game:

The game has four colored buttons: red, purple, green, and yellow.
Each button corresponds to a specific tone.

2...Game Play:
-The game starts by lighting up one of the colored buttons and playing the corresponding tone.
-You need to press the same button.
-The game then lights up the first button again, followed by a second button. You need to press the buttons in the same order.
-With each round, a new button is added to the sequence.

3..Objective:
Your goal is to correctly remember and repeat the increasingly long sequence of button presses and tones.
If you press the wrong button or forget the sequence, the game ends.

4..Difficulty:

As the sequence grows longer, it becomes more challenging to remember the correct order.
The game tests your short-term memory and attention to detail.

5..Winning:

The game can continue indefinitely, becoming more difficult with each new round.
The longer you can remember and repeat the sequence, the higher your score.


The key to success in the "Simon" game is to concentrate and try to memorize the sequence of colors and sounds as it grows. It’s a fun and challenging way to test your memory skills!
